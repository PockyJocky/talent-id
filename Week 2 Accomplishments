# Week 2
This week we have completed some primary objectives while identifying some errors as well as completing hte connection from our front end to the backend.

## Major Changes
..* This week we have completed a refactor of our redux store twice which enables the ability to correctly keep our data in the store.  This enabled us to keep our source of truth to be more accurate and have an effecitve connection to our backend.  The redux store is a key part of how we generate our POST calls from the front end to the back end.  

..* Completed front end to back end API calls for userAdd

..* Set up new Production Node JS

..* Instead of polyfill fetch we did a URL encoded string

..* Build first production bundel

..* Configured connections between all endevors

..* Add controller for interests

..* contorler model and roots for interest list

..* Interest list WIP API caller

..* Added Welcome Page.  This is a placeholder for future development which will allow for choosing between entering user information.  This enables our location logic to be accurate as well as allow for our parent card to be cognizant of all the function going forward.
