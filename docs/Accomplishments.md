# Week 2
This week we have completed some primary objectives while identifying some errors as well as completing hte connection from our front end to the backend.

##Major Changes
1. This week we have completed a refactor of our redux store twice which enables the ability to correctly keep our data in the store.  This enabled us to keep our source of truth to be more accurate and have an effecitve connection to our backend.  The redux store is a key part of how we generate our POST calls from the front end to the back end.  

1. Completed front end to back end API calls for userAdd

1. Set up new Production Node JS

1. Instead of polyfill fetch we did a URL encoded string

1. Build first production bundel

1. Configured connections between all endevors

1. Add controller for interests

1. contorler model and roots for interest list

1. Interest list WIP API caller

1. Added Welcome Page.  This is a placeholder for future development which will allow for choosing between entering user information.  This enables our location logic to be accurate as well as allow for our parent card to be cognizant of all the function going forward.

#Week 3
This week we have completed work on getting unit tests operational and getting complete code coverage of existing work.

##Major Changes
1. Refactored actions and reducers to include constants.

1.  Added an additional page (Welcome Page).  This is to be a place holder so that users will have the ability to choose between entering their information or going ot the search page.

1. Implemented Jest tests on all components which have been created.  This will allow for code coverage and ability to ensure that the application is functional without having to manually check outcomes.
